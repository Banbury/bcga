Prokitektura is a procedural and iterative approach to generate architectural 3D models. A set of small Python functions called rules is used to generate 3D models of buildings. Each subsequent rule refines the model and adds additional details. The concept of prokitektura was inspired by CGA shape grammar developed in ETH Zurich.

Prokitektura can be used to code existing buildings from a number of photos as well as to generate imaginary cities with desired styles of buildings.

An example set of prokitektura rules can be found [here](https://github.com/vvoovv/prokitektura-examples/blob/master/examples/simple01.py). The builing model generated with it can be seen in the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmpAsEqm6mk).
